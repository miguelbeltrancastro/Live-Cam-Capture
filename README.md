# Live-Cam-Capture
Automation tool to continously donwload images from live cams from the internet.

Based on the URL of the image of the livecam/webcam, this tool will periodically download new images. It will check if the image is the same and then not download it.

How it works:
1. Input the URL of the image updated by livecam/webcam
2. The program will download a new image every minute
3. If the image is still the same then it is not saved
